# Liferay Cheatsheet

This repo is an unordered place where I gather code snippets about various topics related to Liferay Development.

## How to use it

The repo can't be compiled or ran anywhere, it's just a collection of files. All files have meaningful titles and are present at the root level, just open the one you are interested into, a README.md-like file elaborating on the purpose of the file will be present at the same level where the file is placed.
